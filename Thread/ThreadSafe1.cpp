// The simplest strategy is to have a single non - static mutex member,
// and have every member function acquire the mutex at the beginning of its body,
// and release it at the end.
// A thread - safe integer wrapper type might look like this:

// Note that std::lock_guardâ€™s destructor releases the mutex automatically.
// Note that the mutex is mutable so it can be locked by get(), which is const.

// Finer-grained locking may be desirable in some cases,
// and when performance is critical, lock-free algorithms may be preferred.
